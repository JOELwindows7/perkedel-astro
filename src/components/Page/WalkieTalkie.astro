                <p>As far we have researched, DMR is just a <b class='error'>complicated glorified POC</b>. If you'd like to buy pure DMR supported Radio, you must ensure that you have what's called <b><code>Hotspot</code></b> in which you <b class='warn'>connect your HT to</b>. You can unify this experience using any POC capable smartphone devices using an app, such as <ButtonizedLink href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dvswitch' openInNewTab={true}>DVSwitch Mobile (Android)</ButtonizedLink>. it combines Radio + Hotspot into just one device. Therefore, <b style="font-size: 1.5rem;" class='error'>You are still required to have internet connection to the Hotspot and/or POC devices</b>, either using Cellular LTE/5G/XG or WiFi or Ethernet.</p>
                <p>Still not believing it? <b style='font-size: large;'>Me too!!</b> But, an <i>Experienced Expert</i> whose happened to be there when I was buying my own HT <u style='font-size: large;'>says so</u>.

        <h2>POC</h2>
            <p>As the world of radio got so convoluted, the world now requires more bandwidth & spaces for people & companies to communicate as reliable as possible. POC presents as the latest protocol that provides all advantages of radio, using a simple yet reliable system, to continue the best communication experience. POC uses already existing common infrastructure of today, which is Internet to establish its communication. Note that it's called <code>Cellular</code> because typically, portable POC radio uses SIM cards to access cellular network. But now, it's simply <code>using Internet</code> since it now also utilizes other connection types such as WiFi.
            <br/>
            POC is very powerful the more powerful the application system is. Your communication experience with POC is basically depends on how good is the application system is, & what features it has.
            <br/>
            Because POC is basically just a Social Messenger, not only it's very easy to use, but also <b style='font-size:xx-large' class='success'><i>More License Free</i></b> (legally speaking). You may still need to subscribe to use and/or obtain certain features, but usually not as strict nor complicated as above 2 protocols.

                <p class='HS Lancaster'>(looked what Belle's looking at) Hmmm, for our case (defeating the Hollows) right now it's not that essential. These are the communities discusing about ham radios of every kind in general, and sometimes general mission critical communications. Well, we already have our own DMR realm (Posko Gaming) for it this. Although if you really curious, go ahead & try!~.</p>
                <p class='HS Info'>Time Check! This game was set around 2090s, whenever after certain numbers of ZZZ endgame chapters.</p>
                <p class='HS Lancaster'>You see.. this list is very ancient, and likely all have gone. But.. doesn't mean you shouldn't try. If there's still accessible, then it's great. But be careful, might by some <b class='warn'>Thugs</b>, <b class='warn'>Rebel Soldiers</b>, <b class='warn'>Ethereals</b>, huh?, or worse, <b class='warn'>Harrassers</b>.</p>

                <p class='HS Lancaster'>Okay, that was too much. uh.., Last time we've been listening to there <b class='warn'>beside of Discord & related of course</b>, .. It's fine. Nothing bad is there so far. Idk about now, considering these days Harrassers are not at terminal numbers and strength, all I could hope is that... either they are no longer active (thinking of overtime decay), or active but still impossibly normal as is (same decay but second possibility). (self-detected screwed up badly on that hope statement) Ugh wait, just.. latter that!. (severely regreted it) I'm sorry, Really-really sorry, I couldn't provide much emotional help to you at all, because I'm not good at lying.. hehe~??</p>
                <p class='HS Eitsch'>We apologize. Perhaps we unknownly had been contaminated for the 5th times in our own world (facing Harrassers, the Ethereals of IRL, a.k.a.

        <h2>License</h2>    
            <p>Radio has alot of potential & it's freedom capability that allows broadcastability by anyone. In order to keep orders in the world of radio, a license system is enforced to keep frequency air cleans from rogue signals. Ensuring the frequencies cleans is essential to keep the safety & security of the people & businesses remain upheld.
            <br/>
            Note, this section only applies typically for Analog Ham & DMR. Some galaxies & realms may require license also for POC / Social Messengers. Welp.<span title="TV Series: Sediron (????). Season 3, After a Harrasser attacked Sediron HQ due to Baser's insists of Block Reason Enforcement, the intergalactic world becomes unsafe for all. Few weeks after Sediron family were thought dead killed by the that Harrasser in their escape realm, (which btw, they are teleported to Saorfa then brought to Areluid now Arenod), Zumi & friends proposed extreme rule that requires everyone around the galaxies in order to even social media is to register for license like driving license, to keep the social air clean. In total, all 3: Ham, DMR, & POC now require license. Although as of Sediron serial and around forward until Surreal Blender Meme x ZZZ fangame, it applies only to Sloantim cluster where Dasandim planet system resides.">.</span> that will be for later days. Well for now, Earth & most planets only require license for Analog Ham & DMR, not POC<span title='looking at you, Harrassers, do not make it harder for us! It could costs innocents too if that happens you know.., Do you really want governments require license just to WhatsApp?? Not funny right..'>.</span> Anyways..
            </p>

            <h3>Obtaining License</h3>
                <p>Following informations are the instructions, website portals, places, & documents to aid people of the region to obtain license.</p>

                <h4>Indonesia</h4>
                    <p>You can visit this website below, SDPPI (<code style='font-size:xx-large;font-weight:bold' class='info'>https://iar-ikrap.postel.go.id</code>). Here, you can register & obtain both Residential (<ButtonizedLink href='https://rapi.or.id/' openInNewTab={true}>RAPI</ButtonizedLink> (Radio Antar Penduduk Indonesia)) & Ham (<ButtonizedLink href='https://orari.or.id/' openInNewTab={true}>ORARI</ButtonizedLink> (Organisasi Radio Amatir Republik Indonesia)) license proposals (to get IKRAP & IAR respectively).</p>
                    <p>👉👉👉👉👉👉 <ButtonizedLink href='https://iar-ikrap.postel.go.id/' openInNewTab={true} style='font-size:xx-large' title='Click here to visit https://iar-ikrap.postel.go.id/'>SDPPI IKRAP & IAR Registration Portal</ButtonizedLink> 👈👈👈👈👈👈👈</p>
                    <p>Once you have registered, chosen which or both to join, paid the fees, & printed the proposal, head over to the nearest RAPI & ORARI offices respectively near you.<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For RAPI, simply complete the fee & process your proposal in the physical office. Once finished, you'll be given callsign few days later that you can read on the SDPPI portal again</li>
                            <li>For ORARI, not only to complete the fee, <b class='warn'>you are also required to take exam in the physical office or place</b>. Track the schedule & location in the <ButtonizedLink href='https://iar-ikrap.postel.go.id/site/informasiUNAR' openInNewTab={true}><code>INFORMASI</code> banner menu, <code>Jadwal Pelaksanaan UNAR</code></ButtonizedLink>. Once finished & you passed, you'll be given callsign few days later that you can read on the SDPPI portal again</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        Please note, <b class='warn'>callsign for RAPI & ORARI are different</b>! Use which correctly on which comm realm you use. Also, the difference between the two are the service area. RAPI is whole Indonesia, while ORARI is international (basically Ham radio in general). If you are unsure, try ORARI first, since RAPI is considerably the <i>LITE version</i> of Ham Radio Comms. Even though is hard & might by toxic (usually from other planets), an old acquintance of mine once said to go there first if I'd like to begin it this radio comms. However, if registering license & how hardcore is the ethic to you, you can try just any POC first.
                        <br/>
                        Chances are, you already did with Discord, MS Team (Formerly Skype & Windows Live Messenger), Yahoo Messenger, TeamSpeak, VRChat, ChilloutVR, etc. Though are less authentic for the context of PTT of course. <br/>
                        Simply learn new morely basic ethics of:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Roger</li>
                            <li>Brik</li>
                            <li>Secu (read: Sekyu) / CQ</li>
                        </ul>
                        followed by name & rough locations, etc. finished with
                        <ul>
                            <li>over</li>
                            <li>ganti</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                <h4>USA</h4>
                    <p>From this experience of the Geerling family, which YouTube video can be viewed below</p>

            <h3>Public frequencies</h3>
                <p>Public Frequencies are basically License Free frequencies. Nations or related in the region have designated frequencies anyone can use without having to join above license (though you are still recommended to join hardcore Ham radio club (ORARI) just to be safe, unless your HT is cheapskate/toy (headless/no-display, less than 1 Watt transceiving, Channel mode only & no frequency mode)), <b class='warn'>on a note, that both you & your device abides with extra rules</b>, such as eligibility exclusive to lowest power headless (no display) simple radio (a.k.a. Cheapskate).</p>
                <h4>Indonesia</h4>
                    <p>In Indonesia, we have</p>
                    <p>...-... Khz</p>
                    <p>...-... Mhz</p>
                    <p>Although, we still recommend you upgrade to Full Version Pentanually (5 year) Subscription by joining ORARI & RAPI.</p>

                <h4>Apps</h4>
                    <p>Many sellers who sell Android based POC HT, recommends that you install these apps of which POC platform used <b>at specific version</b> instead of getting the latest up to date version straight from Google Play. This is due to the compatiblity issues both with the Android version each HT stuck with & the application version that may requires later version just to connect to the server or channel. The following are the examples of which app version you should install to ensure compatibility amongst brikers across universe.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mumla: <b class='info'>vLatest</b> (for Android 5+) (RECOMMENDED, Mumla is an Android client of Mumble (Open Source). The latest version of Mumla as of 2024-10-14 can still run on Android 4.0 & above & does not restrict versions between server & clients unlike TeamSpeak.)</li>
                        <li>Zello: <b class='info'>v5.9.1</b> (for Android 5+) (Optional, No matter what version even the latest, Zello can connect to any free channels anyways)</li>
                        <li>TeamSpeak: <b class='error'>v3.0.23</b> (for Android 5+) (<b class='error'>IMPORTANT</b>, latest version is incompatible with HT dedicated server, latest version server cannot connect to old TS client; <b class='error'>You are still required to buy TeamSpeak legit from Google Play</b> once for lifetime per Gmail logged in to HT, then install Full paid apk of told version to the device)</li>
                        <li>TeamSpeak Server: <b class='error'>v???</b> (for Windows) (<b class='error'>IMPORTANT</b>, latest version server cannot connect to old TS client)</li>
                        <li>WalkieFleet: <b class='info'>v5.5.5</b> (for Android 5+) (Optional, No matter what version even the latest, WalkieFleet can connect to any available server of any version anyways. Some functions such as GPS may not work)</li>
                        <li>DVSwitch Mobile: <b class='info'>v2.0.4</b> (for Android 5+) (Optional, DMR is supposedly version agnostic since it's an open standard)</li>
                        <li>microG (Alternative Lightweight & Portable Google Play Service): <b class='warn'>v0.2.22.223616</b> (for Android 5+) (<b class='error'>IMPORTANT</b>, To ensure compatibility with Android 5; Also it is required for TeamSpeak since the full version still checks <b class='error' title='pirated'>if you sparsdated it</b> or not)</li>

                <h4>UI does not fit small screen</h4>
                    <p>Many cheap Android POC (ones that cost under Rp 1,5 jt) has small screen with a very low resolution, even lesser than typical budget smartphone where most APKs expects their screen size to be. As the result, the UI of these apps forcedly have to live in such a sub-standard sized screen, causing many dialogs & buttons ommited due to other UI elements pushed those out of the visible part of the screen.
                    <br/>
                    You should not worry for your case though, since many POC PTT messenger clients would aware of such issue, as what you would do mostly is just press PTT & perhaps occasionally reply silently by typing some short codes. However, you may find that during configuration you encounters a difficulty of the aforementioned screen size issue above. If you had this, you can resolve this issue by attempting to manipulate the resolution shown on your Android HT, using <b>ADB</b>
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><a href='https://developer.android.com/tools/adb' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Have ADB</a>. There are multiple ways to obtain ADB:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Linux distros should have ADB package on the repository already. e.g., in Debian based distros, just open Terminal & type <code>sudo apt install adb -y</code>, Arch based <code>sudo pacman -Syu adb</code>, etc.</li>
                                <li>Windows has ADB package & configs through Chocolatey (<a href='https://chocolatey.org/install#individual' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Install Chocolatey now if you don't have already!</a>), by typing command <code style='font-size:large;'>sudo choco install adb</code> & accept UAC (Note, the <code>sudo</code> is newly added in Windows 11 24H2 & can be enabled from <code>Settings</code>, <code>System</code>, <code>Developer Options</code>, Enable <code>Sudo</code> checkbox).

                <h4>No signal nor service on this SIM card despite working on other flagship</h4>
                    <p>If you happen to have the SIM card do work on your flagship device, but fail on your HT, chances are, <b class='error'>the HT's IMEI maybe blacklisted or unregistered for the SIM card not in the scope</b>.
                        <br/>
                        If you e.g. have a HT that's based on Qualcomm-Feixun (SMP, Talkcom, Ksun, etc.), you can change the IMEI with a special tool of <ButtonizedLink href='https://mirrors.lolinet.com/software/windows/Feixun/' openInNewTab={true}>Qualcomm-Feixun eMMC tool</ButtonizedLink>
                        <br/>
                        Note also, this process may need be done with the help of the seller you bought this one from since they have a warehouse of spare IMEIs.
                    </p>
                    <!-- TODO: PLS SAUCE YOUTUBE!!! -->
                    <ol>
                        <li>Download above software & extract</li>
                        <li>Open <code>QualcommTool-eMMC-vX.X</code> executable</li>
                        <li>In this window, to go tab <code>IMEI</code></li>
                        <li>Read IMEI by pressing left bottom button (<code>???</code>)</li>
                        <li>Backup this IMEI to safe place!</li>
                        <li>Manipulate maybe last 5 to 8 number to something else. OR use whatever spare IMEI you had</li>
                        <li>Flash the new IMEI back to device with middle bottom button (<code>???</code>)</li>
                        <li>You may need to restart your HT.</li>
                        <li>Pray that it works. If it doesn't, repeat above manipulation again until works. If that too still never works, idk anymore. <b class='error' style='font-size: xx-small;'>I'm sorry</b>.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Tips: use the SIM card best supported & has widest coverage in that nation. e.g., in Indonesia, Earth, it's <code>Telkomsel</code> (State-owned/BUMN) & the MVNOs (Simpati, As, <b class='success'>By.U (BEST)</b>).
                        <br/>
                        Also, Telkomsel do have bonus, such as available special promos for Saudi Arabia travel (Roaming Free I think), because Indonesia is one of the largest number of Umroh participants.
                        <br/>
                        So now you can Zello with your Haj guide people & quickly send signals & receive emergency helps if needed. Pretty cool huh? All is possible because WiFi covers only so much, so Cellular 4G is a must, & important to avoid Roaming as any as possible. 
                    </p>
                <h4>POC-only HTs still got confiscated by customs/bea-cukai even it would not Analog frequency</h4>
                    <p>This is is incorrect, these HTs are still smartphones basically, & never transmit any VHF nor UHF frequencies than the cellular (which are 800s of MHz up to about 2 GHz for 4G & around (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><i>idk</i></a>), presumably also is the same common Cellular frequency of the nation you're going to). You can protest this against the custom that confiscated your properties ensuring getting your PIC/Event Organizers handy. If you also have the approval of HT presence certification documents, please use them also.</p>
            <h3>PC (Windows, Linux, macOS)</h3>
                <h4>Zello not available on Desktop?</h4>
                    <p>Unfortunately, Zello Desktop works only for ZelloWork (Zello for enterprise, paid ones). Public Free Zello is only available on Mobile (Android & iOS). If you wish to connect to the public talk servers, you will need to connect with their remote server which hopefully they have. The instruction & information on how to connect to those alternative protocols usually are available on the OG server descriptions or their YouTube channel OR website.
                    <br/>
                    If you so desire, try to priotize on <b>Mumble</b>, which is Gratis, Open Source, & mostly version agnostic. e.g., you can use the PC (connected to remote Mumble) for listening, & use your mobile/HT-POC device (connected to the Zello) as the mic brik roger.
                    </p>
                <h4>TeamSpeak Error</h4>
                    <h5>Server/Client Version Outdated</h5>
                        <p>This is due to the server that been deployed has been dedicated to lock in that version, hence you can no longer use the latest TeamSpeak Client. On the other hand also, they chose so because many cheap HT POC works best with the old TeamSpeak client (which is 3.0.23), and they would like to make sure it's compatible. Therefore you need to install the old TeamSpeak client as well, with above <a href='#download_APK_divray'>Download APK Divray Jakarta</a>.</p>
                    <h5>How to get old version & which?</h5>
                        <p><b class='error'>Sorry, we don't have this information at the moment</b>. In the meantime, you can try to deploy a Mumble (Open Source) server instead.</p>

    <p style='font-size:xx-small'>Zenless Zone Zero & the logo <code>ZZZ</code> Copyright Hoyoverse<span title="Surreal Blender Meme x ZZZ is a fangame from Perkedel Tecnologies featuring characters from legendary gacha game Zenless Zone Zero. The experience you have been long time ago has now returned in a new formula with the setting at this point now aligns around the release time of this fangame. The story tells about a Hollow that somehow appeared in Surreal Blender Meme realm. Lancaster a.k.a. L (read: Lima) & friends are confused for how it happened. Luckily, Eitch a.k.a. H (read: Hotel) were able to call for help, which are the people from the Zenless universe. Fight all the EWthereals & other thugs once again in the same or similar format as in the original game that has been lost in time, all offline & GRATIS. The reason that we highlight this, is because in this fangame is full of HT Radios usage. In the main story, you get a quest regarding about this very HT & Rigs. From how to use, and utilizations. In the middle of the story, the Surreal Military issued a special DMR-like technology since the Ether consentration around the mission area becomes too strong, it destroyed every types of communication band possibles. The Surreal Military managed to create a special inter-dimensional band that allows frequency to travel not only in realm, but also across realms. It even unifies & simplify DMR connection with the special inter-dimensional antenna, so no more Hotspot will be required. Just 1 hotspot in Arenod Sediron Royal Palace. Spoiler alert, in the final chapter, you will find out that the final Hollow (Hollow Zero of Surreal) was being taken benefit by a Radio scalpers who scalp radios to be destroyed to ruin communication because of his terrible past, which is being betrayed by his own friends. His goal was to destroy all communications so no more connections & no betrayals, by disturbing airwaves multiple alt accounts, etc. etc. ('I am lost, just like you guys' as boss defeated & about to be arrested). This final boss right here while initially looks common, but too strong like Thanos once the epic final fight began. In fact, combination of Proprietarist & Ethereal. Even the final level is like Avengers Endgame, with chain attacks spans more than 3! You will stop chain attack once one of his combination strips off, and repeat until all. First Ether, Second Proprietarism, then Physical. Once defeated, Lancaster arrested him. Invite: Kode Undanganku GJXRV5FG2K https://hoyo.link/7DckFBAL?s_c=GJXRV5FG2K">.</span>
