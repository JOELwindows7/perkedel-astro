    <h2>About DRM</h2>
        <h3>What is DRM?</h3>
            <p>
                Digital Rights Management, DRM, is a really broad term for tech that controls how, and when, digital content can be used - like your games, music, video, or books.
            </p>
            <p>
                Games with DRM include a layer of software or code on top of what's needed to just play the game. Nowadays DRM will send your information to an online server, it could run checks to see if you touched any files, or outright refuse access unless you're logged in somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, DRM is there to question <mark class='warning'>what you're doing every step of the way</mark>.
            </p>
        <h3>Why should you care about DRM?</h3>
            <p>
                Because there is a <strong class='error'>killswitch</strong> built into your games. Sure, DRM might not affect you right now, but corporations hold the key and they'll only let you in as long as you can <strong class='error'>repeatedly prove ownership</strong>. As long as <u>you're connected to the internet</u>. As long as their DRM works without fault. As long <u>they're still around</u>.
            </p>
