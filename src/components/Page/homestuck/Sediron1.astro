    Company *`secret`* Notes! Non-confidential, toxicity trigger possible

    Personal hints. Inspired on tumblr & twitter users blocked Kaorfa & lost
    - Obsesser, retro. begged Robert cardiophile to be drawn. unknown why did Kaorfa got blocked all the sudden
    - Depmon the fox, laila. link to S1E4!
    - Reporster, nerplex. laila's friend
    - Tirta the slime girl, laila
    - Darktoner tachycardia, tenebris
    - Designer, cvalbrown FNF modding
    - ???, Callaghan super visible heartbeat forgot name
    - ???, snowheartsz

    brightenight inspire may not here, unblocked, I think he was hacked, all resolved. Although since he had bad behaviour long-long-long time ago and hated by many, maybe add?
    including annoying ones??
    
    Annoying people Kaorfa remembers:
    - Alasdair Gardineer. wishes to hear my heartbeat everyday back before, when I felt not good to do that.
    - Billy Husada. a Binusian, talked too much info
    - Ray Natan. a stranger in my high school. offered me too weird stuffs & kept doing it.

    maybe also add few still good friends as inspiration? not just cardiophile, every rabbit hole Kaorfa had ever in!

    Episode 4 is death number, pls do topics accordingly per season
    s1 = Background. Sediron during his very young school had gf. He screwed up. gf report gfdad. Sediron beg to be forgiven but gfdad forever permanent hate him for "hurting gf". Sediron ran away, Sdad caught him. gfdad throw stone his sdad's back head, but stand up again ran back home. heart broken in school. gfdad move away from crossban (that's the school name). Principal is also Counselor, Dr. Nabilla. call Sediron fam dad (Hamlet) & son (Baser). say you hurted bla bla bla. that's exageration. Dr. cannot do anything to prevent further trouble. Teacher Farogtel idea to bring kids to amusement park for relaxation, and good news tomorrow is saturday and good time for that. when Baser sat, a shapeshifting girl convinved by her friend to sit next to him, and then flirt (in ID it's `nembak`).
    s2 = Block reason. people has been blocked and cannot access anything. make it so atleast it's accessible & reblogable like nothing happened, except social communication of course.
    s3 = Harm. after days Baser Sediron abandoned, a Harrasser barged into the Sediron office and sliced everything. Fortunately, the server underneath is protected with strongest glass. Police arrived so the Harrasser had to flee. The PR woman (Pink Fox girl Depmon) remerge herself then remerge everything, call help. Restore one guy checking data integrity, and also the PC. session restored too 

    First episode is the season title
    1. Dawn. beginning and usual life of social media
    2. Contribution. durin Homestuck era
    3. Downfall. accusation and close down.

    Random ideas:
    - S2. Exclusive post to. Post that can only be seen by 1 channel. So far, only law enforcements are approved to be eligible for exclusive post. User can upload with privacy set to exclusive and set category to law enforcements. Useful to upload information that leads to arrest of the Harrassers.

    pls use jazz epic drum track for the theme song
