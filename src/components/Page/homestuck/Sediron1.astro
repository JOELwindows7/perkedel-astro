            <!-- 
                submit thesis. done thank you. next student then submit after Baser get out of Gallonder's office

                Tony told his Older sister Mindy, he had just been discomforted because lack of full credit critics

                Mindy make up her mind, permanent hate

                Baser beg forgive, visit house. Mindy reject and if he kept bothering her, she will report to principal so that he expelled. Mindy's dad come and scold go away. Baser lost all choice, run away and cry. Hamlet caught him before he do what he suspect would Baser do.

                Mindy's dad throw stone, hit Hamlet's back head bleedingly, Mindy's mom yay great shot, stand up again and managed to run back home without die.

                Sediron dad & son called, harrasment accusation this is exageration. footage CCTV says otherwise. teachers impressed. principal go back chair, recontinue harrassment in front door, that come to house is true but not the harrassment, I wish CCTV on the road. I saw it with my eyes. Look, gfdad hit me with brick until I bleed, but I'm okay.

                Gallonder saw truth, even he's not Psycologist like his wife, the Principal. Principal agree and answered there's nothing we can do. Hamlet sediron begged his son to be cured
            -->
            <p class='HS Info'>Camera look at right Baser's hand, which carrying the fixed thesis. Baser rewrote credit sections from scratch & restapled everything. & also in current document, appended citation numbers from start to end</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(Walk fast still in upset emotion)..........</p>
        <h4>Resubmit. Teachers working office space</h4>
            <p class='HS Info'>In this room, here where teachers & the Principal sit. It's like a typical office space, with standard muffling corkboard partition separating tables. e.g., they're here when they are not in duty, and had to diligently look at their schedules. Teacher Gallonder sits amongst teachers around him left to the Principal slot. He was playing handheld water ring toss, and he got the last ring to the spear. Camera look at that gameplay</p>
            <p class='HS GallonderArnold'>(Did it blew the last ring onto the right spear) YESS!!! Woo!</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(Knock knock knock the glass door)!</p>
            <p class='HS GallonderArnold'>(Look up high to the door) Yes? (it's Baser) Base..r! Hey, come in!.</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(Push & go in).. (async)..</p>
            <p class='HS GallonderArnold'>(async) (put away the toy ring toss to the table), What's the matter? You done it, or probably need some help?, I presume..</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(stop before table & the chair).</p>
            <p class='HS GallonderArnold'>Hey, sit down! it's okay. (async) I got what you need in here.</p>
            <p class='HS Info'>Full clarification, in Crossban at this time, there is no clear guidance on how to acknowledge people's works like there is no standards learned in this school, including APA bibliography style. Therefore the student just write the name of the authors, the book titles, edition, & what year they were published. Again, without APA guidance, every credit sections designed differently.</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(async) (Sit down to the chair)....</p>
            <p class='HS GallonderArnold'>It's little messy, (put examples of serveral verified mini thesis on the table) but here's the example of how our previous students credited somebody works in this project.</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(handover by putting this fixed teammate work politely to the table)...., Sorry sir. My teammate screwed up.</p>
            <p class='HS GallonderArnold'>(Flabbergasted good way in impression of such revision done quick but also suspicious that it's still too rushed)???, Wait (Hastily flip over to the credit section).., you're so quick but (noticed the credit is unlike ever seen before & began to impressed much further)?!?!?!?!?!?!?...</p>
            <p class='HS Info'>The fixed credit section is very sophisticated. The second heading are the authors, and in this second heading, are the books of the author. Each line (or say subsection) has the title, edition, year, and <b style="font-style:large;">it even includes the ISBN number along with the Crossban Library Assigned Book ID!!!</b>, in case student could not read ISBN. So they can instead refer what book number in library & ask the head librarian to retrieve according to the number here.</p>
            <p class='HS GallonderArnold'>(Even more flabbergasted good way)...... Woooow... Wh... Who did this?</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>Me.</p>
            <p class='HS GallonderArnold'>Wait. You coulda.. coulda asked.. your teammate!... Uh...</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>Well it's my fault I... didn't see this coming. Also we've worked so hard. I can't stress much further after we've all been doing to get this done.</p>
            <p class='HS GallonderArnold'>(Don't want to dig too much) Okay..., (while still sitting, from his POV, slide to right to bring it to the scanner next to his fat PC).... This gotta be told here, may I?</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>Absolutely!, Go head, let everyone know. ... (Concerns for too complicated amount of variables) I mean.., just take the essential parts, like.., especially where you got it from exactly. </p>
            <p class='HS Info'>This is an IBM compatible PC, DAPS2 Model 1000. DAPS2 stands for DasAndimian Personal System slash 2, it's a clone of IBM PS/2 computer because importing stuffs intergalactically is currently way too expensive. So Dasandim as usual spied on Earth with giant telescope & other syndicates to trace lots of blueprints. The OS or more like Desktop environment is Windows 2.1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2.1x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(released in May 27th, 1988)</a>. By that say, these computer issued in Crosban are brand NEW! just released 2 weeks ago after this Windows evolution got released. Yes, they are DOS, but all computers have such graphical environment so teachers can easily use the computer, along with apps targeting Windows. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux was not released until September 27th, 1991</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first Desktop Environments recorded in the list, in 1993</a>. So, Wakturians uses UNIX, with comissioned mission apps in C. Only in that control center, the rests, are also Windows & some DOS only.</p>

    <h2>E9: Areluid & Rumanod </h2>
        <!-- Areluid & Rumanod are 2 females, & they're best friend. They are nomads, together exploring different realms in every travels. They are lesbian, very love each other, and they wanted to marry each other. Alas, and they agree, lesbian cannot biologically marry. They can only wait until the perfect gender pair, by each marrying appropriately, and hoping one day, 2 these offsprings whatever generation, either gender of Areluid & Rumanod have opposite genders so these 2 can technically marry biologically. That's what one priest told them
        One day, during their travel, a storm hits. the lightning cuts the mothership in half. Areluid & Rumanod are in each opposite side of compartment. Areluid on the starboard (right wing viewed from behind), and Rumanod on port (left wing viewed from behind). the port flew to the next unknown realm (which btw is our overworld and fell into Dasandim planet and becomes the first of the first ever newcomer in Dasandim right before Prescott-NASA team which becomes the second newcoming thousand years later), while the starboard crashlanded on this current realm as big as this universe size, & flat world. Both of them and families survived, but also trauma, no longer want to nomad. Only hope one day 2 meet again.
        Indeed, both parties have appropriate straight marriages. But everytime, all offsprings are female, and so they hunt males again.
        about 800 years later, both got their first ever boy. And so now they do is to find each other. Alas again, dimension GPS is still very difficult to build! Areluids are now forever stuck within their own world, and Dasandimians where Rumanods live, can't even find the realm.
        The technology was not finished until this 2031, thanks to Sky's (yes, Last Funkin Moment FNF, the IONIQ Sky) research that have been perfected. Btw, Sky previously wanted to meet her parents again and make it this prototype. White dimension duar Sky FNF taken down, Perkedel moderators resuced her, Wakturia archive appartment, Sky say goodbye to mods go back to appartment, bla bla bla bla, Sky FNF is up again, now Sky is safe yea yea yeah. After Sky, Latsufir, etc. resigned for Wakturia for safety reason, you know, FNF becomes too toxic with unmoderated kids, basically it...., uh.., these 2 worked from home. Aaand, invented interdimensional logistics system. One of the technology that had been invented that time was that Dimensional GPS to index realms available for delivery, which turns out useful in this Series.
        Later in season 4 finale (actually title no longer called Sediron), Duron Sediron (of Rumanod) saved Areluid kingdom. Duron is husband of Chalar Gupadi (of Areluid). Finally, Areluid successfully married Rumanod without LGBT.
        later again, because the kamatussa that wants to force breed defeated, they melt and die turn to acid. Mindy turns out are product of that guy, so first mom melt, followed by Mindy. Pastor heart broken. evac place. when escorted, Pastor force get off and jump. try resurrect, failed. go to hell. Paradise closed down.
        later, speech, spread yourself to different realms. if it's empty, take it. Rubber Glinda was one of them, which then founded Latex world.
        later later, the first Rumanod finally met the first Areluid once again after eons separated. then get to introduced with Duron & Chalar. They are married, so, dream comes true. now Areluid & Rumanod can rest well, forever. No, not died. idk. First Areluid & Rumanod for final time to do ceremonial üòèüòèüòèüòèüòè as a celebration. Duron & Chalar surprised, but then followed in to üòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòè because it's over, happy ending.
        Areluid & Rumanod then disintegrate into stars. Oh no they die? the first offspring Areluid came in reassembled from star into the scene. No, they don't die. Just turn into star, here I can do this too. demonstrate, reassemble, see? That's Areluid first power!
        Oh..
        Areluid & Rumanod becomes star particle, now wraps entire realm, accompanying whole people in it, and also beyond the realms.
        Combined. into Arenod.

    <h2>E10: Ban</h2>
        <!-- Harrasser began to rise near the end of 2024. Ban them. Boss battle, almost battle, canceled because one helper throw the boss instantly to Judgement. Minions afraid & left scene -->

    Episode 4 is death number, pls do topics accordingly per season
    s1 = Background. Sediron during his very young school had gf. He screwed up. gf report gfdad. Sediron beg to be forgiven but gfdad forever permanent hate him for "hurting gf". Sediron ran away, Sdad caught him. gfdad throw stone his sdad's back head, but stand up again ran back home. heart broken in school. gfdad move away from crossban (that's the school name). Principal is also Counselor, Dr. Nabilla. call Sediron fam dad (Hamlet) & son (Baser). say you hurted bla bla bla. that's exageration. Dr. cannot do anything to prevent further trouble. Teacher Farogtel idea to bring kids to amusement park for relaxation, and good news tomorrow is saturday and good time for that. when Baser sat, a shapeshifting girl convinved by her friend to sit next to him, and then flirt (in ID it's `nembak`).
    s2 = Block reason. people has been blocked and cannot access anything. make it so atleast it's accessible & reblogable like nothing happened, except social communication of course.
    s3 = Harm. after days Baser Sediron abandoned, a Harrasser barged into the Sediron office and sliced everything. Fortunately, the server underneath is protected with strongest glass. Police arrived so the Harrasser had to flee. The PR woman (Pink Fox girl Depmon) remerge herself then remerge everything, call help. Restore one guy checking data integrity, and also the PC. session restored too 

    First episode is the season title
    1. Dawn. beginning and usual life of social media
    2. Contribution. durin Homestuck era

    Yeah that's for another story, but you got the idea.

    now what to do with Sediron after these all taken down after 2030? As Sediron now is in ASTR, the workers salvaged technologies in Sediron and able to repack individual utilities into 32 packages. Sediron want to give it to Crossban. ASTR wants to upload all for everyone to use, and then what maintainer? Crossban? Sediron leave to his bedroom meaning agree. Okay Crossban got the win then. Upload for all, Crossban Social & Communication IT Faculty maintains it.
    In total, Sediron has been recycled as a Fediverse compatible blogspot. Crossban uses this for announcement purpose. Students will be followed to each faculty & generation channel that follows their class & semester evolution, as well as general Crossban school news channel. The Group chat feature in a channel is added with subsections per something like subjects or fun sections. The block feature & others can be removed in the instance configuration. Crossban removed block channel. Troubled student can also be suspended temporarily or expelled registration wide permanently. Crossban disallowed student to create post or bring reblog to here. But anyone can reblog from Crossban to other Fediverse. This is the feature used in Marketing department to e.g. sharing registration availability announcement across many social media, especially those with Fediverse enabled ones.

    E8 on S1 is Banning harrassers

    Bonus Note:
    after Pastor John Halim found had thrown brick at someone, Dasandim banned him permanently. He moved anyways, to the worst planet Dr. Hymatt, Zumi, & Roig originally born at. There he established megachurch. He felt successful like, God did the promise. Aaand.. the Megachurch is about only Good news, never the truth. All the Sunday Church are all only overprepared shows praising Gods, few minutes sermon which also only Good news. Never all the negatives especially the Revelation era (Raptures and alike). Yes, all atheist "repent", but that's only because of these sugarcoated candies!!
    But hey, atleast eventually the entire city turned from slum to paradise, right? (it's sex paradise) RIGHT???
    God will win you the casino, like wtf, let's not hear this anymore.

    Bonus again:
    every Dasandimian saucer has spy chips for company logging purpose. the driver in Dummy Test Guy & Damefo episode forgot about that.

    Bonus bonus:
    Areluid & Rumanod after all these happy ending learnt how to fuse together like Steven Universe. With Areluid's power copied to Rumanod, they accidentally fused themselves into 1, like gems in Steven Universe, when they're one day to solidify from star dust form. Tumblroid! Eventually, Arenods have perfected the technique and now it's the latest common practice.
