    brightenight inspire may not here, unblocked, I think he was hacked, all resolved. Although since he had bad behaviour long-long-long time ago and hated by many, maybe add?
    including annoying ones??
    
    Annoying people Kaorfa remembers:
    - Alasdair Gardineer. wishes to hear my heartbeat everyday back before, when I felt not good to do that.
    - Billy Husada. a Binusian, talked too much info
    - Ray Natan. a stranger in my high school. offered me too weird stuffs & kept doing it.

    maybe also add few still good friends as inspiration? not just cardiophile, every rabbit hole Kaorfa had ever in!
