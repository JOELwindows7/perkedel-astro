    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>After couple months being living in Perkedel internal realm doing mundane works in ASTR, Sediron seeks redemption. Or more like, something that makes him glorious, since he had too less crime, only accusations.</p>
        <p>And then suddenly, he finally got what he wished for. Does it run well though?</p>
    
    <h2>Exiling</h2>
        <h3>Boredom. ASTR Work complex. Perkedel Internal Realm. 2031</h3>
        <!-- 2031 -->
            <p class='HS Info'>Baser arrived again in this office prepared & suited up, to work again. Again, he's still working on support, where he do simple helps & delegating workers to help when got asked to. Still there is nothing interesting in ASTR, and all is feels like desert silence. In this workspace, the only partition is per worker desk. The room is very wide and contains over thousands of desks spans across acres, yet, only Baser & Aad sits here. Camera OFF, then fade in slowly as Baser walks. btw, don't worry, Perkedel Internal Realm ammenities are gratis for employees in this universe. Also for the real life atm, we don't have enough power yet ðŸ˜œ sorry.</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(walk to his desk far of in about corner far opposite to the door he in from)... ... ... ... ..., (greet boringly & depressedly) Morning..., (continue walk)</p>
            <p class='HS Aad'>(look Baser) Morning, sir! (continue staring)</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(yes still walking 50 cm left)... ... ... ... ..., (slide out chair), (sit), (snuck in), (turn on Monitor), (stare).... </p>
        <h3>Outside of the office</h3>
            <p class='HS Info'>It is null silent! No wind, only air sitting on each other. B roll camera static around the area and the building.</p>
        <h3>Center Park</h3>
            <p class='HS Info'>Perkedel provides internal park for leisures & relaxation of the employees in this universe. somewhere, there are alot of statues to tribute great events, and also tragic events. The ground are designed so wide area of green grass are exposed, and trees must not cover majority of the area. If they had to, then it means it's a dedicated tree spots for limited area (Small Forest spot), like statues occupying slots. Duron & Chalar are currently relaxing near a Hyundai IONIQ 5 lifesize replica marble statue. Chalar leans closer to the car, making her in between Duron and the car. Duron & Chalar are close each other. They lean by the starboard (right, steering wheel) side, about 50 cm away. Their head points as the back of the car, so the feet goes to car front. The car inside has detail, although not complete, with steering wheel on the starboard (right) just like in Dasandim (& right steered countries) config.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(almost asleep).....</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>(noticed the Hyundai IONIQ 5 but it's stone) Duron. (tap right shoulder), hey!..</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(sleep streak meter broken, look Chalar) huh, yeah?</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>Is that looks just like our car? Why did somebody turn it into a stone?</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(look car stoned) Huh, idk. Maybe Kaorfa likes it, so.. I think he make the replica? lol??</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'><b>Ah ha ha ha ha ha!!</b></p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Well, (async) you see, </p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(async) (surprised a moderator is here on starboard away again from duron, look Arn)</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>(async) (surprised a moderator is here on starboard away again from duron, look Arn) huh?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Every statues we have here are for tributes.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Oh, okay..</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>(look the car stone) This (offer point to the car) one right here.., is a good memory, despite all the struggles. We..., saved a young lady.</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>Oh cool! Who is she?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'><b>Sky</b>.</p>
            <p class='HS Info'>both Duron & Chalar impressed & interested. For your information, it was during Last Funkin Moments. Sky was one of the survivor from a destroyed dimension when she was looking for her parent. She joined Wakturia, for only then had to resign (voluntarily say yes to that offer announcement day, together with Latsufir & others) due to unsupporting social condition at that time (which to this day still not safe anymore).</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>(async) OOOoo.. . Tell me more about it!</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(async) OOOoo.. .</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Yeah. She was looking for her parent. Since baby, she must be separated, because an evil religion extremist forced them all citizens who are demons to eat their baby. And then, her parents made replica out of her, record video eating it, send to that extremist. It works, and fooled him, forever. Never know that it was a fool, as he was eliminated by Sky herself during the gambit siege. Yadi yada, now... they live in a dimension Latsufir's dad bought out of winning bid years back, along with whole families, inventing new stuffs.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Woow... Oh I like stuffs. But what is this statue to do?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Well, the.. I'm sorry if this sounds like a... shameless promo, Sky likes to drive the car. Aaand.. This is the car. She drives it everyday. Where she goes, with her husband, it's this. I mean.., your planet, endorses it, it's everywhere there now. Idk why.. It's just..... iconic.</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>Interesting........</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Hey. Do you aware if there's more realms I could help out with?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Hmmmm, this is pretty difficult apparently. With Harrassers have conquered, more than they lost, I think I should say.... leave it to be. Unless..</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>ðŸ¤¨....</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>There is one. ... One that I... Have interest to.</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>What is that?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>No idea how, why, when..., But... this realm, everytime we randomly query this, it had an emanating signal..., like.. umami if... tasted with heart....</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Okay, what's so special with that one?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Well, ever since you were here, our querying feels.. different. In every touch, of this dimension.., that is the one <b>ALWAYS</b> ....., emits this never felt before aura. It's that one.</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>Name?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>People out there call this <i class='info'><b>Areluid</b></i>. Well because, the first settler was named Areluid, hence and forth it's just <i>Areluid</i>. It's <code>she</code>... and, They (people of there) have been there 2000 years ago, and they've got greatly sophisticated civilization.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Okay. Then what's something wrong?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Right. There was a war. long year war, since year about 1500 AD something. A Colonizer tried to take over that place. From sieges, battles, and finally, stuck settled with divisions.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(same old war is boring) Ugh..... Boring!..., (expecting something that could restore reputations somehow) If only something that we could make it right!!, or just have me the <b>{nsfw?`shit`:`8888`}</b>!!!... So that... my dad.. can live normally, all that <b>{nsfw?`bullshit`:`88888888`}</b> gooone!. Heugh......... (tightened semi whisper voice) Gooood....... (stil semi whisper, right hand press forehead in depression) Whaaaaiy....., Ssssssss.....</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>...</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(still normal volume) JUST PLEASE!!... <b style='font-size:large;'>Unblock my family</b>, God!... I don't do anything!! My dad's not to mention! We had to live!!.... AARgh!!..........</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>... I wish could do help you son. But... neither me, nor Kaorfa himself could do anything. Reality in us world... is broken.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>So what? I have to wait until Jesus comeback who knows when?! (scoff) Heh!..., guess I got to freeze myself anyways</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Son.. please don't freeze</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>What, <span style='font-size:large;'>WHAT</span>, <b style='font-size:xx-large;'>WHAAT?!?!</b>. (tear drop of stressed out).... (sniff)!!, ... (blow nose)... (right nosestril full mucus) Huuh?? You can't help me, not even Joel (Kaorfa) could?? What's the point?!</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>(also tear drop stressed out) He had.. he had been.. also in this bad situation. I know you.. you had done something right should've been done. But apparently, they insisted karenly. .... Look, I know you gonna say you shouldn't have done it, but did anyway, did you?</p>
            <p class='HS ChalarGupadi'>(soothe by wrapping from Duron's left / port side of body)</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Hhhh... (take out handkerchief from right pocket), (blow mucus out)!!!!!!, ugh.. I just wanted to clear dad's name. He didn't deserved this. He didn't do that (that grave crime of children things). Idk.. He just.. (increasing crying point) like being <i>father figures</i>, (clear nose with handkerchief)!!!.., Haih..... I..... It just made them madder. I forgot to tell, what did he do to the press, Haaargh... no.... He's just.... <b>Block Reason</b>..... among things.... aand... sauce... <b>Sauce</b> (Forced Attribution in Clarification bar on a post). ..... I forgot.</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Well.. It looks like you had same set as Kaorfa. You know, he's just trying to attribute a reuploads. I know.. maybe your people might be rude or just no matter what. And perhaps yes, I know you should just let it go (ignore clean dad's name or in Joel's case ignore ask <b>why he blocked</b>). But you see, these days, nobody can prevent hate speech from spreading around, and does so <i class='error'>she</i> hated him forever and ever. And you certainly, can no longer beg, for the associated to get out of there and apologize. No. Never been in neverary.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Okay, let go, fine. And I have no place to live, I'm rotting.</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Remember. You got 1 realm. Like it calls you.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>...</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>If you atleast win that realm, who knows, you got more family, than ever before, even more than that that Pink wolf lady <i>No no no, not you Chalar</i>..., who likes to <i>carress some heart organs</i> but hated Joel in defense of that asshole guy claiming to be an old friend of her. <b style='font-size:large;'>HECK</b>.., <b style='font-size:xx-large;'>EVEN MORE!!!</b>.., than.. all the Harrassers combined. coz infact, there is... (remembering rough counts) uhh.... mmmm... (found it) AH, <b style='font-size:10em;'>10 BILLIONS!!!</b>, last time.. AAh, more than.. anybody, ... in galaxies combined. (chuckle joy) What?... She??.. Nn no, not Chalar, the other she, other other she. Ahem.. She.... guy.... and Harrassers... <b style='font-size:large;'>smooooool</b>. THat.... <b style='font-size:10em;'>BEEEEEEG</b>!. Who knows you can find coincidence, or tell em to make em shape like</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>STOP convincing me, Mister Telemarketer, Hang up, <i class='error'>BLOCKED</i>. ......</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Just kidding (tight stop).  .... (mouth closed, larynx very almost shut gradual open, and so blow to nose) mmmmmmhhh.. What you do want?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Offering you place!.., You say here, feel free, or try win it? .. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ Heeh???</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Well how hard is it?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Well..., so far it's just territorial issues. aaand.. you just maybe settle a peace, or uh.. if that colonizer is beyond salvation, you could just get rid of them, and let... Areluid wins. Simple.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>When?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Anytime!... soon.., you can.. call everyone here first, And I'll send you there. We got agents here to help you there. As consultant. And you can sneak in around do your thing. yeah!.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>... Okay, the specific?</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'>Alright, ... ... here we go.., ...</p>
    <h2>Infiltrate</h2>
        <h3>Areluid central sky area</h3>
            <p class='HS Info'>This is the drone B roll of Areluid center city. change to various fly around the castle. You can see the main castle over over there. Watch, that the dialogs written in <i>italic / teks miring</i> marks background voice over</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'><i>So..., you are a <b style='font-size:large;'>Lithium Consultant</b>, ... You know.., Areluids are engineers and they need battery. Invent new and better batteries, all volunteers are accepted to help. But also, as a scientist, you can also explore different space just a little bit.</i></p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'><i>Right. How do we get started? I mean, how do I say I got here?</i></p>
            <p class='HS Arn'><i>Uhh... let's see.. .. ..</i></p>
        <h3>Royal Resort. Areluid Main Castle</h3>
            <p class='HS Info'>B Roll of this mega and royal hotel inside hallways. Followed by facilities around it (swimming pool, tennis badminton basketball court, billiard house, luxury restaurant, ballroom, mini golf courses excluding top golf and real golf).</p>
            <p class='HS Arn'><i>Ah, you'll stay here, and yes you ask, say that... you found the poster. You know, uh.. the poster were spread also to select few realms. <b>Luckily</b>, that somehow circulated to Dasandim where you from. Praise the Lord, you can say that.</i></p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'><i>Huh. Do I got to wonder tho?</i></p>
            <p class='HS Arn'><i>Nah, don't worry, usually they don't care for this one. uhhh, just be cool, like usual. But <b>don't forget</b>, your mission (to save Areluid from eons of colonizations). eeuuh... I believe you can get there somewhere.  ... No no, don't worry about anything. As long you... are not one of those, which is you are, ... I have confidence, 99 percent.., no matter what, you be fine. They only look after the colonizer to Block. That's it.</i></p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'><i>Okay, you claim I definitely be safe. You must be kidding.</i></p>
            <p class='HS Arn'><i>I'm serious. I've been looking every realms for eons, and for this one, they've been in greatest torture from just really 1 single company. <b style='font-size:x-large;'>One</b>. No kidding.</i></p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'><i>(feels like that God apologized for getting them through grave days for no apparent reason at all) Oh my God. God, You finally regreted for letting us all through this, You... (mchtsk)! {nsfw?`(unable to say "dickhead" towards God)`:``}.... You know..</i></p>
            <p class='HS Arn'><i>(telepathically heard Duron insulted God) Ayy!!.. that's not polite, I know you're angry. But remember, we're on a mission here. We better spend all energy to focus here, and then if all works out, then we can return to ranting God if you want (with great confidence Duron would forgot or no longer interested to do it afterward as it worked).</i></p>
        <h3>2nd Floor VIP Room hallway</h3>
            <p class='HS Info'>Fade in <a href='https://youtu.be/0ZUoFPLlVQU?si=vMcLmxNuD5u7QS7y' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creo - Sphere</a>. Duron & families has occupied this exclusive room number 2001 (Floor 2, number 1). the hotel guy, Standford was the one carrying the families luggages. Followed by B-roll Duron tidying up stuffs, where the volume of BGM is already at peak.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'><i>Ugh.. fine by me I guess. Got other realms in case I faile?</i></p>
            <p class='HS Arn'><i>No, unfortunately no.., But I'll try my best to find another one as many as I can. Well if emergency, maybe Sky & Latsufir would accept you, idk, as the 1st second resident (in Salt Flat World realm). But I'm pretty sure, it'll work, like these (the Areluid realm) are already yours since the beginning.</i></p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(mark the end spot) Yeah yeah, just put it here.</p>
            <p class='HS StandfordAreluid'>Are you sure sir? I can do tidy these all up for you.</p>
            <p class='HS Info'>Sediron families have entered the room in a heartbeat.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>No, thank you. I'll take it from here. You know... for safety.</p>
            <p class='HS StandfordAreluid'>I see, I can understand that. Well good luck!, because your day starts tomorrow. Oh! don't forget to look around this hotel! there's alot!</p>

            <p class='HS AudioInfo'>Just audio silence if available</p>
            <p class='HS Info'>Volume BGM full Beat drop & B roll Duron & families tidying up stuffs ...</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint</h2>
        <h3>Still in this room 2001.</h3>
            <p class='HS Info'>Stop music & return to usual dialoging. Italic voiceover marking dismissed. 3 Sedirons are discussing what to do. the girls from mom including kids (Grandma Ananda Topilar, Madam Nylar Rumanod, Nita Sediron, Turial Sediron, Desi Sediron) are auditing items and further tidying stuffs. The room is considerably small, like only 3 star rating. Only it's scaled up a bit, to area of just around 430 m<sup>2</sup> or something. The bathroom unlike most hotels, are installed far corner away opposite of the door at left, instead of sitting next to it. and the beds are also in that opposite away from door, right side by the bathroom. The bathroom door is side, where perpendicular where fall to bed. The main door is wide twin doors. Before the bathroom, hence between main door and bathroom and at left, an all in one multi-purpose make up table with mirror in the center of the table. the window to the city, on the very right, spans across that right wall, from bed board height to the ceiling. Although, only the bed side had clear window. The rest are permanently stained colored glass with fracture pattern. That's just coincidence, all VIP rooms for stained glass have this fracture with random color pattern.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Okay, here we are..</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>Son, are we allowed to look around?</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>No dad, please don't, everyone. We're on a mission. Idk how {nsfw?`fucked`:`888888`} up this realm has been, considering the situation given. So please. ...., stay safe. I have pre-downloaded offline games for you.</p>
            <p class='HS HamletSediron'>Isn't that Kaorfa's Steam library again?</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>No, Grandpa. We can't do that anymore. He could get trouble once Gabe saw him locally <i>borrowing something too many times around families</i>. No.. not again. Kaorfa had itch files instead.</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>Aargh, forget about it. Dang, I wish I could spend myself and grandkids to Billiard.</p>
            <p class='HS HamletSediron'>(throw self to bet, tired) (async)!!! (instantly fall asleep)...</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(async) (look grandpa threw himself to bed and asleep instantly).... (look each other)</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(async) (look grandpa threw himself to bed and asleep instantly).... (look each other)... (look window to city view)</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>.... Okay. Just view the world. don't get too close. Only wait for the mission. I also have ordered the hotel to just bring all food to here.</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(look back) Okay why?</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>No getting out at all. Idk if Harrassers could be here, you spotted, you die. We're all die.</p>
            <p class='HS BaserSediron'>(retriggered the fatal ala-Oppenheimer heartbreak of the accusations)...........</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Alright, I'm sorry dad. ugh...... Just wait. It'll be over I guess...</p>
    <h2>Consulting</h2>
        <h3>Outside the room. Next day</h3>
            <p class='HS Info'>Jared the Professor has been waiting for the consultant to accept the escort and tour the science research. Duron has already prepared. Other hotel guards have been on stance guarding the Sediron families strictly, as well as more guards watching carefully from outside this castle. standing in ledge, sitting on top, snipers everywhere, etc. like guarding president. Them all are feeling the never felt before signal, that tells them Sedirons are a treasure you might be looking for eons, you've lost once before, or something. Hence why they felt this needs president level of guard. While Duron is out, the rest stays and made safe further by these guards. Despite the available offer to get outside and further guarding, Sedirons decided to be discipline for safety, to stay inside all time, until next order.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>... Yeah, great luck GBU, see you later. (open port bathroom side door left)..., Alright, what are we doing here? (close door)</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>Doooo-ronn.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Yes?</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>Hai, (walk closer) I'm The Professor. But people called me Jared..</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Aah.. Professor Jared. (greet)</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>Yes (accept greet)! ! ! So, can we start?</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>What do you know?</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>Right, follow me! (escort to special railway)</p>

            <p class='HS Info'>The MRT will go to right. Therefore the starboard (right) doors that opens, presenting them the way. Rail pathway drives on left, so, MRT comes that left railway in perspective. Put camera on other empty railway opposite platform, to look this railway. Safety door & MRT starboard door opens</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>(finished await door), (hand gesture offer you first) Alright. .....</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(not brave because this could be a trap).....</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>(remembered Duron's situation) Oh, sorry. (enter first), c'mon.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(enter)...</p>
            <p class='HS AudioInfo'>Starboard doors & safety door close!, MRT run forward, to the right</p>
        <h3>Tunnelway to Science Center.</h3>   
            <p class='HS Info'>Still no music. The next stop is to the Science Center just a couple kilometers away. This MRT has very fast speed up to about 500 Km/h. Although of course, all routes only runs for up to 100 Km/h for safety reason.</p> 
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>So..., Duron. What gets you up here?</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>I saw a poster. I mean.. looking for a new job, my company that my dad built tumbled so bad.</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>(pitiful of this bankrupt) Whoa, I'm so sorry about that. May I know in short?</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Yes I know, long story. (not bankrupt, it's toxicity) But short, not what you think. Money is okay... Societies.</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>Oh. ... ... I recently heard that there was somekind of... Harrasser thingy going on.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Yeah that one. They conquered essential stuffs, and used that power to destroy my family good names. For good.</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>Damn, sir, you do not deserve this. I'm pretty sure you'll find yourself home here. But...</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>I'm sorry about the war too. I do not need to ask deep. Just what's going on? I know, long story. But what do this colonizer looking for?</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>They want to increase... resource. Idk. They want to conquer us just like the Harrassers. We've been here the first time, and whatever the colonizer do, ... eet's bad.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Well, let's just look forward. What do you have in there?</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>We are looking to improve <i>Battery</i>, our energy storage. Recently I heard that somebody out there discovered making the core of the battery solid instead of typically liquid. A little less efficient, but way safer. In case of say.. trouble, the catastrophy is very minimum. We tried different methods, buut you see to no avail that works as good as the one we had right now.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>I see. I think I can help you with that.</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>Okay, thank you..., I hope we do find it.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Sure.</p>
        <h3>Science Railway Station. Science Center. Basement</h3>
            <p class='HS Info'>Arrived. Duron had instinct to jump off as the port side doors open to avoid potential explosion I think.</p> 
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>Okay, here we</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>(Jump off the MRT to port side, afraid the MRT could explode as professor stepped off)!!!</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>Whoaaaa, don't go too fast, you could trip!.</p>
            <p class='HS DuronSediron'>Uhh yeah, we arrive yes?</p>
            <p class='HS JaredAreluid'>(Did not think to put explosive nor any harm at all but anyways).., (stand up & walk off) Anyways, Welcome, to the Science Center. (camera stop, but keep walking leaving camera)</p>

            Dr Hymatt transform service. met customer (who wish to install human form for human-con party in ballroom underneath the main castle) with coincidentally very identical name (the earth name, not their birth name) to ones who hated / blocked Baser, from dad mom daugher and younger brother. even they came up with design matches with the look of each and everyone of them. They are entirely different people but somehow had same look, and not the assholes.

            pls don't forget heart experiment we stole from Laila & Nerplex. compilation of heart torture collage. https://www.tumblr.com/purity-in-heart/740411342805254144?source=share this one. If you're blocked by original poster, no matter, you can't reblog nor like. Say "feel free" but she hated me in defense. Break the patent rules, but always attribute no matter what. God will reply, I hope.

            Oh, the final technology of heart was coming also from Discord but forgot which reply was it. an invincible heart installed on Judy Hopps something. With any explosion, the heart stands. So I want this build like carbon nanotubes, made muscle, and the nanotech acts as extra bearing and to rebuild the broken cells. Of couse by default it also cleanse LDL and plaks. Then, the Areluids in stardusts form learn how to control the carbon in the air and form nanotubes as they reassembles to form.
