    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Sediron is a fictional social media exist here in Perkedel Cinematic Universe. Founded in Dasandim in 2009 by Baser Sediron & families. It is here to provide not just a communication, but also amazing creativity, where imagination is the only limit. It's to gather all Dasandimian as well as intergalactic beings to tell stories & share great events.</p>
        <p>In this season, the mission has been failed, despite all efforts from many parties (of the good side) across galaxies. Harrassers somehow managed to win all medias across galaxies and began using it to spread propaganda, that since this conquer, are no longer debunkable by any truthblowers, nor even disputable by any means. In Harrasser's revenge for their arrests against, Sediron, has been accused with grave crime that all around him witnessed nothing such, but it's made validated anyway (except Dasandim of course).</p>

            But the damage has been done.
