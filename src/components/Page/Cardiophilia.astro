        <h2>Discord Invites!</h2>
            <p>
                Discord is supposedly not recommended by Perkedel,
                But yeah, alot of heartbeat communities dwells there.<br/>
                It is not recommended because:
            </p>
                <details>
                    <summary>These reasons:</summary>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each account only allows 100 joins in free tier. get Nitro / Premium subscription to increase this limit</li>
                        <li>Many of server owners & its moderators of the server around the world yeets certain group of people. If you find yourself in those sus servers and your specs are in their target list, 
                            you could be banned for life! So immediately unjoin once you've found out how degenerate these rules are. Note, not all server does this, thankfully, idk which.<br/>
                            <span style="font-size:.75em;">
                                If you found any of those server below with mentioned behaviour, 
                                please 
                                <a href={"https://github.com/Perkedel/perkedel-astro/issues/new?assignees=JOELwindows7&labels=bug&template=bug.yml"}>
                                    report bug immediately
                                    </a> 
                                (with title tag & name of server as listed bellow like 
                                <code>[Discord Karen] ENTITLED_SERVER_NAME</code> 
                                & attach as all as possible proofs such as screenshots & chat logs) 
                                and we'll comment it. 
                                So pls stop this behaviour if you don't want to be commented.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                        <li>Obviously, you may need account, because perhaps some servers do not accept anonymous join even Discord indeed has this feature.
                            Yeah not to mention anything joining anonymously, anonymous join is messy anyways!
                            <!-- Ya, jangankan join secara anonim. join anonim itu berantakan! -->
                        </li>
                        <li>Some servers fails to age gates contents, therefore we'll put them in NSFW. Join at your own risk!</li>
                        <li>Last but not the least, obvious perma-ban from each server themselves. 
                            Okay, I know we have perma-Yeeted too, but unlike Discord, you still can see everything, not deleted if possible,<br/>
                            and of course, we tried our best to make serverely offending entities' accounts strictly limited 
                            to just contributing useful stuffs that's it, not hating it.<br/>
                            Impossible, I know!, we're trying our best to and infact it's our mission collect everything as all as possible, 
                            get them all preserved, no matter background something. Idk how do I receive any questions atm.
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                </details>
            <p>Anyways, here servers*.. if you want, I guess..<br/>
                <span style="font-size:.75em;">*Servers we haven't untested its 
                    age gate, explicitly restricts to mature only, OR failed the age gate 
                    will be presumed / placed in 69420</span>
