    <p>
        Admiral Zumi has received report from Kolmorolotzzet department that all of the workers are serverely tired busy managing assets,
        as well as experiencing tremendous amount of fear about the fate of all of the assets they've collecting 
        over the past few years.<br/>
        A discussion has been started regarding the opportunity to welcome all 3rd party hoarders preserve everything that kolmorolotzzet 
        had collected, to help relieve in event of tragedies such as data corruptions & losses.<br/>
        If X0p1r4t3 & Perkedel agree, We expectedly to prioritize publishing all assets 
        that likely cause no bad consequences in doing so.<br/>
        With due respect, we expect for all gamers to be cooperative during this discussion and whatever decision Kaorfa would he finally choose. 
        We have been experiencing immense amount of sorrow due to loss of the assets we haven't yet acquired.<br/>
