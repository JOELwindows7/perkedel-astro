<li><ButtonizedLink href="https://skfb.ly/oxZY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pablo's sculpt of Godette Chan but zahlenmaller rigged it</ButtonizedLink>
    based on <a href="https://cloud.blender.org/p/gallery/60b7a091e781884330b23588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this thing that was Pablo was sculpted</a> (including posing it destructively directly with that bend sculpt tool instead of rig bones ðŸ’€). 
    Awesome div by zero, Extremely impressive, considering that the model was indeed bent without reference T-pose whatsoever since Pablo directly sculpt the pose as is, or I missed the T-posing history, idk.
