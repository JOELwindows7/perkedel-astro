<h3>DialogLog</h3>
<p>
    <span class="HS JOELwindows7">Ahei, Dasandimian!</span>
    <br/>
    <span class="HS VriskaSerket">Oh cool, A CSS Stylizer for our HTMLLog!! 8ravo!</span>
    <br/>
    <span class="HS TereziPyrope" aria-label='Terezi Pyrope says, "And MarkdownLog also, if we put that too here. So far so good, yeah!"'>AND <code>MarkdownLog</code> 4LSO, 1F W3 PUT TH4T TOO H3R3. SO F4R SO GOOD, Y34H!</span>
    <br/>
    <span class="HS JOELwindows7">Perhaps. wai wait. I got an idea.</span>
</p>
<p class='info'>Tips: Ensure that all text in your HTML-log can be read by screen readers normally. Especially, Terezi's caption style is leet-speak. Hence it would mess with screen readers. Use <code>aria-label</code> to label the normal text so the screen reader would read that instead. <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/26032207/9079640' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to see StackOverflow answer about Aria Label solutions.</a> Remember, when Terezi lost her vision before, she can still use PC like normal due to her backup abilities, But other people who are also had vision trouble & even lost their vision do not have the same extra backups as her is. Therefore having a way for their screen reader or any similar system to be able to read aloud such text properly is essential.</p>
<h3>DialogLog per Paragraph</h3>
