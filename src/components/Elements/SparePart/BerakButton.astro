<!-- I'm confused now!
- I think holding poop is discouraged! But then
- `Puke` / `Muntah` is disgusting and means a disease
- `Castract` / `Kebiri` is too dark and maybe a permanent desire loss
- `Poop` / `Berak` is natural
Then what & how am I supposed to philosophize this?
poop on command? maybe?!??!?
