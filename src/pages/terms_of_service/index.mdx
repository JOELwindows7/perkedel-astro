# Terms of Service
pls wait!...

Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct will be applied soon at undefined date.

## For Users / Gamers

HERE

## For Developers / Contributors

### (BASE) Code of Conduct

insert here

### Consents Required

In order to be able contribute for Perkedel Technologies, you are expected to consent at following aspects

#### Core Motto

Consent that all contributions shall be:

- Gratis.
- Open Source.
- Full Version.

#### Usage scale

Consent that all contributions will be used for any scale but not limited to:

- General.
- Limited\*.
- Restricted\*.

\* Restricted & Limited usage scale shall be skipped if contributors age do not meet biological mature level. However it will become mandatory 18 days after their eligibility birthday due to **desires from gamers that we have no right to control**.
Additionally, for such lesser than mature case, ones **shall not be forced** to contribute to these non-general scale before they reached aforementioned eligible age, at their biological mature birthday + 18 days after.

Even contributors with eligible age exclusively contributes for General scale, they are still required to consent to next 2 scales due to **above aforementioned desires from gamers** that we have no right to control.
However, **by contributor(s) request, we have rights to temporarily forbid** Limited & Restricted fanart from gamers & contributors based on other contributors whose ages are less than mature. **This forbid only last until** contributors has finally reached their biologically mature birthday + 18 days after.
After which following date, no related forbid shall be reapplied furthermore.
Note: there are a chance that some not yet eligible contributors allows Limited & Restricted fanart at least on certain specification (Which is about screwed up honestly, idk..),
for your safety, we suggest gamers to / gamers may **avoid using such assets for those 2 scales at the moment** until from the time of contributor's statement,
they've grown to eligible state + 18 days after.

If contributors could not make account due to status lesser than required, they may borrow parent or guardian account on behalf.
We also recommends all contributor whose age less than biological mature to also be supervised.
Although parents & guardians may optionally supervise already matured contributors if need be.
(Because guess what, there is a chance for some contributors to have toxicity e.g., & this often happens because nobody's looking at them, so they can bully everyone as they please, that's not welcome.)
