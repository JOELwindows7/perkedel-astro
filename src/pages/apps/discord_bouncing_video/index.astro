    <h2>What's going on?</h2>
      <p>These are WEBM videos each has frames with inconsistent size & aspect ratio, causing the video to <i>bounce</i> due to frame image selection updates that had different size.</p>
      <p>The <i>bug</i> was found in Discord Desktop app (an Electron app of Discord client) as such, the video shrinks & grow like crazy when the video with that inconsistent frame size is played</p>
      <p>This happens because various things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discord forgot to add some kind of heurestic to capture its initial size & make it make sure the player keep it that way</li>
        <li>WEBM allows possibility for inconsistent frame size as mentioned before. Pictures of different size can be packed together and still a valid WEBM file. ✨✨ WOW</li>
        <li>Browsers (such as case with Chromium based like Discord Electron, Chromium derivatives, & Chrome) by default for <i>video</i> tag without <i>width</i> & <i>height</i> defined will update player size to whatever current frame the size it was right now. We tried putting the size & for Chromium, the video still bounces inside while its player stays its size</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Preserve the funi bounce video moments</li>
        <li>Guarantee the working <i>bug</i> even if Discord killed it</li>
        <li>Provide sample for researchers later down the road.</li>
