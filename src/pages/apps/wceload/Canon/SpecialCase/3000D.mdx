## Info:
### Threads
- [EOS 4000D / 3000D / Rebel T100 Development ](https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=23369.0 ) I saw no development. I shall attempt!
- [EOS 4000D / 3000D / Rebel T100 Development All page ](https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=23369.0;all )
- [EOS 1300D / Kiss X80 / Rebel T6 Development ](https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=23369.0 ) We were told by `a1ex` himself to go follow here after that main 3000D thread.
- [Initiated Introduction at ML forum](https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=26712 )

### Steps:
- [Dump ROM](https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=16534.0 ). **Not yet!** (I have to wait for my younger sister finished her semester (around April-June 2023) first before I can risk my own camera! Maybe DM me for ROM file?? idk.., OR convinve me just ROM dumping `FIR` never bricks the camera.)
    - Does just running ROM Dumper `FIR` has potential to brick the camera? If 0% brick chance, then I can just do it now!
    - ~~I have no contact yet for you to give me the ROM at the moment. I shall reserve username, yeee..~~ Magic Lantern forum username = `JOELwindows7`
- [Prepare QEMU](https://foss.heptapod.net/magic-lantern/magic-lantern/-/blob/branch/qemu/contrib/qemu/README.rst ).
    - Seriously updated the Magic Lantern hg repository to `qemu` with `-C` argument. in `magic-lantern` directory, `hg update qemu -C`!
    - `./install.sh` with WSL
    - hangs at `Initialized empty Git repository in /mnt/w/kolmo_simple/Artistic_Setups/MagicLantern.fm/qemu-eos/qemu-2.5.0/.git/`. how long? is it hang? or is it processing?!?!??!?!
    - nvm, it goes again. Yes, it took long time.
    - Let the script compile QEMU as well.
    - damn! it errors again!
    - kay you know what, like said just bypass those `WError` with `./configure-eos --disable-werror` in the `qemu-eos/qemu-2.5.0` directory. keep in mind the `qemu-eos` repo is outside this `magic-lantern` directory!
    - try just do
    - **still error!** here last [`install.log`](/assets/txt/logs/attemp_ml_2022-11-16_22-53/install.log) & [`config.log`](/assets/txt/logs/attemp_ml_2022-11-16_22-53/config.log). Pls help what's wrong?!?!?!??!?!??!???!
    - VM trye faile VM hang
    - QEMU reticulatedpines not working. [issue](https://github.com/reticulatedpines/magiclantern_simplified/issues/76 )
    
    - Dump the ROM now! (Pls wait! Waiting for my younger sister to complete her semester with Photography subject. I think about Feb to June 2023. If you can convince me that just running ROM Dumper `FIR` definitely do not brick my only camera, **I can do this now**.)
- Reattempt porting ML.
    - Prepared the ML source
    - Test compile anything.
    - FAILED! here last [`make zip`](/assets/txt/logs/attemp_ml_2022-11-16_22-53/make_zip.log) log!
    - [names_are_hard replied](https://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=20214.msg240975#msg240975). Kay, you told me to change things in the `Makefile.top`, okay, hold on. let me [this](https://github.com/reticulatedpines/magiclantern_simplified/commit/4a6e5e666e52e56aaf3447f9d112b3fc791e38f3).. and then [that](https://github.com/reticulatedpines/magiclantern_simplified/commit/af10c16925912f864f4e218532dc9ac4e5af358f)..
    - Right, For QEMU, I gotta learn how to make configurator points to modern QEMU. well let's just try the ML compiler first. `make clean`! `make zip` again.
    - faile! `module_string` missing! here [`make zip`](/assets/txt/logs/attempt_ml_2022-11-19_16-37/make_zip_again.log) log again.
    - Oh wow, just as I go back to reticulatedpines' magic-lantern simplified everything works again. that's not the qemu. I test compiled the 100D version. here [`make zip` log](/assets/txt/logs/attempt_ml_2022-11-19_16-37/reticulatedpines_make_zip_local_100D.log). it even had the [zip file](/assets/zip/magiclantern-Nightly.2022Nov18.100D101.zip) on hand. Yes, clicking that downloads it. I think I should try the others. Note, that one I have no `Makefile.user` file there, just let it uses the `Makefile.user.default` entirely.
    - okay, just the 200D ones ironically does not work. [here `make zip` log](/assets/txt/logs/attempt_ml_2022-11-18_16-37/simplie_make_zip_again_again.log). Dude, what did make yours work? Think I should make issue [over there](https://github.com/reticulatedpines/magiclantern_simplified/issues)?
    - EOS M version works too! [download zip](/assets/zip/magiclantern-Nightly.2022Nov18.EOSM202.zip), see [`make zip` log](/assets/txt/logs/attempt_ml_2022-11-19_16-37/simplie_make_zip_EOS_M.log).


### Stuffs
- [ccritix's 3000D Platform folder](https://github.com/ccritix/magic-lantern/tree/branches/1300D/platform/4000D.100 ) Complete with Stubs. Lacks the Installation folder atm. OR try using libUSB method?
