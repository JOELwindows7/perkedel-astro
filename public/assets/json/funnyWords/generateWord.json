        "Last night, Joel had an incident with his side hustle. There was technical issue that cause his salary likely to suffer. <br/>He cried big to his mom as this incident costs him significantly, because of course, just $0.01 obviously losses breaks everyone's heart to the max. <br/>But then his mom told him to stay grateful as she told a story on her job.<br/>She was about to get promoted to the highest level of the role in the manufacturing facility, but then a leadership had changed causing restructurizations. <br/>Joel's mom got a whole different role to what described as Operational & Safety.<br/>People believed this is the lowest of the low because essential what this role does is to design how factories should work & how to make it safe.<br/> Well actually it's very essential! You screw this, everything screwed!. <br/>Turns out she enjoyed it because it is more relaxing unlike her previous role, where that role took significant part of her living and had to accept every alerts on an unwanted time whenever the manufacturing machine got issues. Also that role causes you have to stay even longer to make sure everything works okay essentially in work hour. <br/>Now with this new role, Joel's mom simply has to improve the working rules & safety rules of every factory the company she works on has, across different regions. <br/>If a disasters like pandemic has to happen again, at least she can manage things online, meet online, and discuss from home, unlike before where of course it's impossible, you gotta see it. <br/>So in conclusion, you got incident, God turns out saving you from that worse incident ahead of you. <br/>I wonder what about Joel's? adding more redundancy so he can match whatever last data he got & make sure it is correct? Well, that feels unsatisfying, even Joel agrees. <br/>There has to be something more that had prevented him from getting killed if he didn't got the incident. Infact his department ironically lacks a technology which is an internal data keeping that workers like Joel can see immediately or something, like.. that Silicon Valley company is big, yet this department didn't have convenient way of knowing how many stuff he worked on, hence he has to count all by himself.",
