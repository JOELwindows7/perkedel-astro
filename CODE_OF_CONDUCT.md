# Code of Conduct extension for: Perkedel NTLF+ASTR
- again, credit where you get it from! at least you must place URL sauce.

## Copy Writers
- **Only use Polymod ModCore system**. Avoid creating separate & standalone executable
- use `main` branch to start. clone & it must start at (oh no, idk yet, but has to be inside `/apps/your_blog_things` directory). If somes features you wanted lacked, submit an issue or become `Contributor` by edit hack add something missing bellow.
- 

## Contributor
- use `???` branch, create new edit hack branch from here & pull request to `???`.
- Clearly state what changed & state at least the URL where stuff you yoinked from. You made a feature? great! what is it? did you yoinked someone's code? Okay, that's okay too, just tell us where did you got that from.
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the rules. There's not only rules, but also background checks which are not optional to follow.
- Pls obey the background check result! If you got rejected for **offending backgrounds**, fork & netlify your own, we won't do anything because this project is `GNU GPL AGPL v3` & as long you obeyed this license, we'll leave you alone. Just.. **you'll be bullied by people who had the similar idea with me** (again, only if you are e.g. Paywallist, ask patron DM for download, all that karenly stingy stuffs).
