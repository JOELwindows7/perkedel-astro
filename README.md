# Perkedel NTLF + Astro
Perkedel Technologies website on Netlify with Astro framework

https://perkedel.netlify.app
# Okay, cool..
## What is this?
It's another website we have, now we're trying Netlify.

## Why Astro? Why Netlify? Why has to type?!
Netlify seems very popular for website hosting. Many Open Source projects built their presence upon this. AND the best thing is, the website project are linked from a Git repository. Yep! that's right, just edit the git repo, push, and your website is updated! Amazing awesome!!!

For Astro, I just chose it. It seems great, I heard you can have multiple JS framework stuffs in it, it's versatile. I am still confused though what frame I should've had. I thought that I should start reserving `perkedel` first foremost with something that had a lot of flexibility, and it happened that it's Astro.  
I was initially going between Astro OR HUGO. I wanted to HUGO because it's a generator, Markdown to HTML. But too late, I already had Astro, infact last night Astro gonna win that day. And today, it is. sorry HUGO, but maybe later.

Okay I get it. it's not GUI editor. Well, I should try typing too, I already have experience with GUI editor from website hostings like Google Sites, Wix, Square.. no that's not $0, uh.... Weebly!!, Wordpress.com, I think that's it. These tends to have performance issues, and very unreliable at times, many factors. Not just our PC, but browser, their server, whereever could be a bunch of bottlenecks.  
Listen, I do not need internet just to edit my website. I got the owning copy here, edit now, and when internet available, I got there.  
Beside, somehow GUI editor is unreliable too, I want to put this element here, but then it came there instead. RIght, I know CSS is haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard!!! I want to type so it looks like this but it came that instead. Yeah pretty double irony here. I can't answer this well.
