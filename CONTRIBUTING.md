# Contributing for Perkedel NTLF+ASTR
## DISCLAIMER
Please still contribute anyway despite your discrepancies with your background checks such as Paywallism (>$0), Proprietarism (No PSD, No Download Link), and/or Partialism (DLC >$0). Kaorfa may still accept intresting articles, tips, files, etc. etc. Usually, he is about lenient and accept everything that intrests him and/or provides usefulness towards all gamers. 

## BE CAREFUL!!!
IMPORTANT!, Always watch what did you put in. Everything that you put in must be $0, and if you dare tp violate this, there will be heavy consequences.:
- **NEVER** Insert Paywalled files link sauces (Patreon, Gumroad, Fanbox, etc.), especially your own assets (if that assets has no tutorial how to exactly remake 1 to 1 like Ducky3D.). Doing so, will cause all employee or Kaorfa himself be ordered to buy all offending files, **& then reupload them for $0** (with of course link back original buy links). **This includes all derivatives such as ports as well!!**, e.g. a $0 SFM models which original Blender model is not $0. So if you want to promote your file here, you need to know this first.
- (TEMP) For 3D model violations, the consequences only applies for if `.blend` file is not $0. This is temporary & may at times void anytime.
- For other types, the consequences applies only to original project, not its derivatives. e.g. Magic Lantern is $0, but there are some derivatives such as `A` version but it's not $0. we can shoo that out and hope protesters join in by improving Magic Lantern to have the same or better features as `A` had. different again if it wasn't, like say.. Original MIDI is not $0, We ask you to remake ones here same or better. 
- If a file **That has already listed in this website where formerly was $0, Open Source, and/or FULL VERSION** suddenly become paywalled, proprietary, partial either this version or next, **Immediately comment NOT delete** the sauce link & create issue about this. For best resolution possible, apply Be Careful Violation No. 1 above. (TEMP) Please only apply to files that has already existed in this website at the time it's there. (TEMP MEAN: if void means `Also apply to files haven't been here yet`)


## How to do this?
- Fork
- clone that fork
- add something. be sure to add everything inside `src/apps/your_addition_things`.
- Pull Request to `main` here.
- State what did you add.
- Make sure to state also **all your social medias** as all as possible, that includes Money Jars like `Patreon`, `Ko-fi`, etc. (PRO TIPS: Simply link your bio-linkers like `Cointr.ee`, `card.co`, or Odysee post containing all your social media URLs). Kaorfa & Saorfans may reply with an interview about this background checks if necessary (Don't worry, we make sure it's only right at the Pull Request, no DM, no call phone, no SMS, no 3rd party, right in your comment section).

### Prerequisites
- Git
- GitHub Account.
- GitHub Desktop (or any GUI Git)
- Node JS, the packages are managed with `npm`.
- VS Code (or any IDE)

## RULES, **IMPORTANT**!!
### OBEY
- **Must give sauce URL** where did you get that from even it is dark, illegal, screwed up. **DO NOT JUST MENTION THE NAME, GIVE THE URL OF THE ARTICLE TO EXACT POST**
- properly rate the `rating` meta tags! if it is 69420 NSFW, fill it with `adult`! so it becomes `rating: adult`.
- Sparsdat / Piracy / reuploads is not allowed in here (at the moment). For that, you go to `X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment 0NET`. We don't have Zeronet working at the moment, only [`X0p1r3t3 Eenvreensment ODSY`](https://odysee.com/@X0P1R4T3-33NSVREENMNT-0FFICIAL:f ). This entire project source code is being hosted at a Git server where DMCA is possible. Please wait until we found decentralized or anything where DMCAing is impossible 100%. (TODO: Test spardating? NO don't)
- **No adding any extremely horrible real life activities** with scopes of such as but not limited to.. this, that, there, you know what I mean. Exceptions for fictional & sandboxed virtualized environment, although **still, just don't add anything terminally screwed up** that would still be screwed up regardless whether if it is containerized or not, you know what I mean.
- If you are adding a not $0 and/or restricted stuffs, you must waiver all of them into $0, **that includes the highest quality version AND the source code (PSD, Blend, Maya, Max, etc.)** you would lock behind your money jar, **as well as permit permanent non-limiting use without permission required (but still attribution)**, remove all Digital Restriction Managements, and waive any restrictive request & requirements. Additionally **you are required to allow 69420 use also non-limiting & permanent, without permission required**. Therefore if you do not want to have obey this, then don't add **NOR** promote that your art you commercialize in first place, unless again you waive all of them you put here. By putting those here & pull request, you are agree to this non-cancelable agreement settlement for all files you've added here. Perkedel will not refund *accidentally agreed* settlement once the pull request has been merged (no unless at the moment). You may still ask donation.
- **Be sure to respond any replies on your Pull Request!** Ignoring this for more than certain times (1 day to 5 weeks) **means you say `YES`** and the **merging process usually won't be canceled**.
- If you accidentally added files that you shouldn't have added, **ONLY SIMPLE DELETE THOSE FILES**, **NEVER USE Time travel purging (select file to delete file in every commit)!!** Doing Time travel purge may likely disqualify your pull request & possibly ban you from contributing, until you added the mistaken file back to history somehow (once you added them back, if you want to delete then use SIMPLE DELETE!). Time Travel Purge may only be used if you accidentally uploaded e.g. Wallet Private Keys, Account Password (**not to be confused with RAR ZIP Password of your 3D model**), and any password or keys of credentiality.

### Background check points
Please have a look at the following checklist. You will need to **pass at score `100%`** (TODO: pls leniencify!) in order to be accepted for merging. Additionally, you must **pass this exam all the times** to keep your eligibility. The answer will change if you deviates any of them such as start paywalling by the next version, etc.

### OMG BACKGROUND SO HARD ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€!!! PLS GIVE ME SOME EXCEPTION!!! FAQ!!!
It is up to the Kaorfa that will grant you gamers the exception. e.g., If you make 3d models that are not $0 but had its tutorial to make them like it exactly 1:1 like Ducky3D, then you maybe eligible for the exception. Again, make sure it's most of the tutorial, maximum paid tutorial is 1 per month or varies depending on Kaorfa's subjective choosing.

#### Sample Exceptions
The following are the sample cases where Kaorfa would still accept your Pull Request. Please note these are based on subjective thinking of Kaorfa & may change at anytime. Also note, that even if your cases are listed here, you may stil get rejected / accepted depending on Kaorfa's mood.

`- sample case. e.g. Person examples`

- You make 3D models and/or Plugins that are not $0, but you had its tutorial how to make it like this 1:1 exactly. Ducky3D (though may have Patreon Exclusive tutorial), CGMatter, IanHubert, etc.
- You make tutorial that are not $0, but your 3D models are $0. [JCThornton](https://www.patreon.com/jcthornton/posts )
- You do not share the source code of your software, but all / most of the softwares are $0. [NirSoft](https://www.nirsoft.net/ ) (only few sofwares are not $0)
- You post $0 project but the insider beta version requires subscription to your money jar.
- You post $0 art but the newer art are on held behind your money jar subscription for certain time period.

- Despite your next / current version of your 3D model is not $0 & Aware that your files have been pirated / sparsdated, you leave it alone and even supported it (optionally ask donation).
- You guarantee that you keep the availability of your MIDI files since you disallow reuploading.

#### Sample Rejection
The following are the sample case where Kaorfa no longer accept / Just reject your Pull Request because e.g. betrayed everyone not just me. Again, these are subjective & will change at anytime.

`- sample case. e.g. Person examples`

- You initially had 3D model v1 for $0, but by the next version v2 is no loner $0 OR unavailable / private. ...
- You have not given sauce URL to what game you were recording, you ask payment to get it & you sometimes scammed them by asking PM first. K...K Cultured ........
- You are actively cracking down sparsdator either your own or someone else. Known your notoriety for DMCAing alot. ...
