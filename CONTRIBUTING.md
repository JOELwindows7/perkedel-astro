## How to do this?

## RULES, **IMPORTANT**!!
### OBEY
- properly rate the `rating` meta tags! if it is 69420 NSFW, fill it with `adult`! so it becomes `rating: adult`.
- Sparsdat / Piracy / reuploads is not allowed in here (at the moment). For that, you go to `X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment 0NET`. We don't have Zeronet working at the moment, only [`X0p1r3t3 Eenvreensment ODSY`](https://odysee.com/@X0P1R4T3-33NSVREENMNT-0FFICIAL:f ). This entire project source code is being hosted at a Git server where DMCA is possible. Please wait until we found decentralized or anything where DMCAing is impossible 100%. (TODO: Test spardating? NO don't)
- **Must give sauce URL** where did you get that from even it is dark, illegal, screwed up. **DO NOT JUST MENTION THE NAME, GIVE THE URL OF THE ARTICLE TO EXACT POST**

### Background check points
Please have a look at the following checklist. You will need to **pass at score `100%`** (TODO: pls leniencify!) in order to be accepted for merging. Additionally, you must **pass this exam all the times** to keep your eligibility. The answer will change if you deviates any of them such as start paywalling by the next version, etc.
