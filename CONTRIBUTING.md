# Contributing for Perkedel NTLF+ASTR

**Contributing file has been moved to https://perkedel.netlify.app/terms_of_service**
## DISCLAIMER
Please still contribute anyway despite your discrepancies with your background checks such as Paywallism (>$0), Proprietarism (No PSD, No Download Link), and/or Partialism (DLC >$0). Kaorfa may still accept intresting articles, tips, files, etc. etc. Usually, he is about lenient and accept everything that intrests him and/or provides usefulness towards all gamers. 

## BE CAREFUL!!!
IMPORTANT!, Always watch what did you put in. Everything that you put in must be $0, and if you dare tp violate this, there will be heavy consequences.:
- **NEVER** Insert Paywalled files link sauces (Patreon, Gumroad, Fanbox, etc.), especially your own assets (if that assets has no tutorial how to exactly remake 1 to 1 like Ducky3D.). Doing so, will cause all employee or Kaorfa himself be ordered to buy all offending files, **& then reupload them for $0** (with of course link back original buy links). **This includes all derivatives such as ports as well!!**, e.g. a $0 SFM models which original Blender model is not $0. So if you want to promote your file here, you need to know this first.
- (TEMP) For 3D model violations, the consequences only applies for if `.blend` file is not $0. This is temporary & may at times void anytime.
- For other types, the consequences applies only to original project, not its derivatives. e.g. Magic Lantern is $0, but there are some derivatives such as `A` version but it's not $0. we can shoo that out and hope protesters join in by improving Magic Lantern to have the same or better features as `A` had. different again if it wasn't, like say.. Original MIDI is not $0, We ask you to remake ones here same or better. 
- If a file **That has already listed in this website where formerly was $0, Open Source, and/or FULL VERSION** suddenly become paywalled, proprietary, partial either this version or next, **Immediately comment NOT delete** the sauce link & create issue about this. For best resolution possible, apply Be Careful Violation No. 1 above. (TEMP) Please only apply to files that has already existed in this website at the time it's there. (TEMP MEAN: if void means `Also apply to files haven't been here yet`)
- These Carefuls executes no matter who added the files whether Kaorfa himself, you, or anyone that proposed the features, etc.
- **NEVER** Insert any content that you do not want to be 69420'd / Rule 34. By pull requesting to here, you are agree that all files to be allowed to be 69420 even if on the original site states otherwise. There has been rampant kamatussaisms going on here, and in Perkedel Technologies, kamatussa is not welcome.
- Even in case of special situation (except age depiction) such as drama, **you still have to allow 69420 no matter what**. You may still leave warning about affromentioned situation, **except disallowing 69420 itself**.

## Chances
### OH NO! I didn't know! pls don't reupload my paid work for $0!!! I need to eat & buy vape & luxury sport cars!
- You will be given chance to make change of your fork. Either comment `<!-- like this -->` the offending file or best which I hope you have, allow me reupload OR you grant exclusive permission with us for that these files for $0. You have no time limit but until the fate of pull request.
- By default, unresponded pull request with offending links **will be closed**. that includes your extra useful informations.
- By default, all existing $0 file that betrayed into not $0 or any betrayal **will also be commented out**
- If there already too many closed pull request with this reason, Perkedel may execute `Extraction` campaign which is, we will merge as many as useful pull request, but don't worry, **offending files will be commented**, not buy & reupload. We're not evil monster ðŸ˜‰.
- If there already too many betrayed files, Perkedel may execute `Meltdown` campaign which is we will reupload everything as much as we can **for $0**. Note that Kaorfa stated that it is rare, would be unthought by usual, and only by unknown occurence shall he do run this campaign.

### YOU PERVERT!!! You talk to your mom like that?
- You will be given chance to make change of your fork. Either comment `<!-- like this -->` the files or best which I hope you have, grant exclusive permission with us to allow 69420. You have no time limit but until the fate of pull request.
- By default, unresponded pull request with kamatussa links ~~**will be merged with 69420 allowed no matter what**~~ **will be closed**. that includes your extra useful informations.
- If there already too many closed pull request with this reason, Perkedel may execute `Extraction` campaign which is, we will merge as many as useful pull request, but don't worry, **kamatussa files will be commented OR kept as is with error added**, not force allow 69420. We're not evil monster ðŸ˜‰.
- If there already too many betrayed files, Perkedel may execute `Meltdown` campaign which is we will edit and/or uncomment everything as much as we can **with 69420 allowed**. Note that Kaorfa stated that it is rare, would be unthought by usual, and only by unknown occurence shall he do run this campaign.

### Jesus christ, chill! I *`ask you not to make porn`*, not *`it is illegal to make porn`*!!
- Oh, Okay. So.. I still can 69420? Personally? No no, I have to publicize this video here, Just.. exclusive to Odysee.

### um, yeah!
- Oh thancc. I thought.
- Man, kamatussa has been rampant these days. it makes me upset & felt that these people are lying, said they let us have it, but actually not. They aren't ready, gutless, to have their *artwork be used freely*. No, they could not. They have no such gut. Being letting your artwork used freely isn't just a simple grant. Every all grants, except the one that used to destroy (that's for another day). All you must allow, without expecting people to ask you one. Myself is shy & too lazy having to answer calls, you should too. That includes 69420. livings are perverts, me too! And that's by design, you can't deny this. So, unless you're too young at the moment, (interupt received: `Allow`) There you know! well, no need to say this again. I don't need to teach you again like a newbies because you are a big person already (kamu tuh udah gede), unless you are notorious for cheating in the copyright & licenses exam.


## How to do this?
- Fork
- clone that fork
- add something. be sure to add everything inside `src/apps/your_addition_things`.
- Pull Request to `main` here.
- State what did you add.
- Make sure to state also **all your social medias** as all as possible, that includes Money Jars like `Patreon`, `Ko-fi`, etc. (PRO TIPS: Simply link your bio-linkers like `Cointr.ee`, `card.co`, or Odysee post containing all your social media URLs). Kaorfa & Saorfans may reply with an interview about this background checks if necessary (Don't worry, we make sure it's only right at the Pull Request, no DM, no call phone, no SMS, no 3rd party, right in your comment section).

### Prerequisites
- Git
- GitHub Account.
- GitHub Desktop (or any GUI Git)
- Node JS, the packages are managed with `npm`.
- VS Code (or any IDE)

## RULES, **IMPORTANT**!!
### OBEY
- **Must give sauce URL** where did you get that from even it is dark, illegal, screwed up. **DO NOT JUST MENTION THE NAME, GIVE THE URL OF THE ARTICLE TO EXACT POST**
- properly rate the `rating` meta tags! if it is 69420 NSFW, fill it with `adult`! so it becomes `rating: adult`.
- Sparsdat / Piracy / reuploads is not allowed in here (at the moment). For that, you go to `X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment 0NET`. We don't have Zeronet working at the moment, only [`X0p1r3t3 Eenvreensment ODSY`](https://odysee.com/@X0P1R4T3-33NSVREENMNT-0FFICIAL:f ). This entire project source code is being hosted at a Git server where DMCA is possible. Please wait until we found decentralized or anything where DMCAing is impossible 100%. (TODO: Test spardating? NO don't)
- **No adding any extremely horrible real life activities** with scopes of such as but not limited to.. this, that, there, you know what I mean. Exceptions for fictional & sandboxed virtualized environment, although **still, just don't add anything terminally screwed up** that would still be screwed up regardless whether if it is containerized or not, you know what I mean.
- If you are adding a not $0 and/or restricted stuffs, you must waiver all of them into $0, **that includes the highest quality version AND the source code (PSD, Blend, Maya, Max, etc.)** you would lock behind your money jar, **as well as permit permanent non-limiting use without permission required (but still attribution)**, remove all Digital Restriction Managements, and waive any restrictive request & requirements. Additionally **you are required to allow 69420 use also non-limiting & permanent, without permission required**. Therefore if you do not want to have obey this, then don't add **NOR** promote that your art you commercialize in first place, unless again you waive all of them you put here. By putting those here & pull request, you are agree to this non-cancelable agreement settlement for all files you've added here. Perkedel will not refund *accidentally agreed* settlement once the pull request has been merged (no unless at the moment). You may still ask donation.
- **Be sure to respond any replies on your Pull Request!** Ignoring this for more than certain times (1 day to 5 weeks) **means you say `YES`** and the **merging process usually won't be canceled**.
- If you accidentally added files that you shouldn't have added, **ONLY SIMPLE DELETE THOSE FILES**, **NEVER USE Time travel purging (select file to delete file in every commit)!!** Doing Time travel purge may likely disqualify your pull request & possibly ban you from contributing, until you added the mistaken file back to history somehow (once you added them back, if you want to delete then use SIMPLE DELETE!). Time Travel Purge may only be used if you accidentally uploaded e.g. Wallet Private Keys, Account Password (**not to be confused with RAR ZIP Password of your 3D model**), and any password or keys of credentiality.

### Background check points
Please have a look at the following checklist. You will need to **pass at score `100%`** (TODO: pls leniencify!) in order to be accepted for merging. Additionally, you must **pass this exam all the times** to keep your eligibility. The answer will change if you deviates any of them such as start paywalling by the next version, etc.

### OMG BACKGROUND SO HARD ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€!!! PLS GIVE ME SOME EXCEPTION!!! FAQ!!!
It is up to the Kaorfa that will grant you gamers the exception. e.g., If you make 3d models that are not $0 but had its tutorial to make them like it exactly 1:1 like Ducky3D, then you maybe eligible for the exception. Again, make sure it's most of the tutorial, maximum paid tutorial is 1 per month or varies depending on Kaorfa's subjective choosing.

#### Sample Exceptions
The following are the sample cases where Kaorfa would still accept your Pull Request. Please note these are based on subjective thinking of Kaorfa & may change at anytime. Also note, that even if your cases are listed here, you may stil get rejected / accepted depending on Kaorfa's mood.

`- sample case. e.g. Person examples`

- You make 3D models and/or Plugins that are not $0, but you had its tutorial how to make it like this 1:1 exactly. Ducky3D (though may have Patreon Exclusive tutorial), CGMatter, IanHubert, etc.
- You make tutorial that are not $0, but your 3D models are $0. [JCThornton](https://www.patreon.com/jcthornton/posts )
- You do not share the source code of your software, but all / most of the softwares are $0. [NirSoft](https://www.nirsoft.net/ ) (only few sofwares are not $0)
- You post $0 project but the insider beta version requires subscription to your money jar.
- You post $0 art but the newer art are on held behind your money jar subscription for certain time period.
- Your service (not product) is not $0 for obvious reason (to feed landlords, no permanent purchase, greedy organisations, feed maintenance workers, etc.). [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Linode](https://linode.com), etc.
- Despite your next / current version of your 3D model is not $0 & Aware that your files have been pirated / sparsdated, you leave it alone and even supported it (optionally ask donation).
- You guarantee that you keep the availability of your MIDI files since you disallow reuploading.

#### Sample Rejection
The following are the sample case where Kaorfa no longer accept / Just reject your Pull Request because e.g. betrayed everyone not just me. Again, these are subjective & will change at anytime.

`- sample case. e.g. Person examples`

- You initially had 3D model v1 for $0, but by the next version v2 is no loner $0 OR unavailable / private. ...
- You have not given sauce URL to what game you were recording, you ask payment to get it & you sometimes scammed them by asking PM first. K...K Cultured ........
- You are actively cracking down sparsdator either your own or someone else. Known your notoriety for DMCAing alot. ...
- You hate fanarts especially fan games & DMCA everyone of them. Nintendo (Legal department which members are actively supporting this idea, not other Nintendo employees especially those who reject this idea either follow order or not)
- You did not let anyone reupload lost 3D models & uncertain fate about that 3D model download. M... P..., ..., etc.

#### FAQ
##### Do I have to make sure I obey all of these?
Yes. Although to be clear, if you only put some guides, then I think I can put aside the stuff you didn't promote. Well, if you do promote stuff, again that's when I'll get strict.

##### Wait does that include everything?
Yup. all of them, must be Downloadable, for $0, Open Source (PSD AI included), FULL VERSION (no censor allowed, no patreon / paid exclusive uncensor). **Even the old stuffs you embarrassed to share to the world.** But..

##### OH MY GOD!!! You're an asshole! I hate you so much!!!
I'm not finished yet, even you had old stuff you embarrassed to share hence you disable the download, or whatever patreon exclusive you had, **you still have chance to be accepted**.

##### What, so you're gonna accept but comment out my promotion link of my patreon so you want me hungry?
... Fine you win this time. It's our policy, unfortunately.  
Look, I want to help you, but if I didn't have this rule here, all you get is cancelation, not just me for being a hypocrite, but you too. 
<!-- Don't you know we have a visitors from X0p1r4t3 here? these citizen does something, and you could give a clue to them do get every measure, yeah you don't want ...  -->
I can help you. Just bring the file here, **& I'll make sure that you who knows get the donation you've always wanted**. Look at FOSS developers out there, no! not that guy, these!! They also have free *beer*, and since they liked the *beer*, they buy them *coffee*. Easy as that. Company needs those *beer*, so look at them at the platinum sponsor tier, they gave them *wine coffee* so FOSS developer can brew the best *beer* world never imagined before.

##### But
I know, not all people going to have guts to just do it, they're stingy, I know. But you've already had those who better spend it somewhere instead of sport cars to hoard. Yeah? 

##### No!! get my Patreon link here!!!
(sigh)!... I'm trying to help you. If you insist, then it's a violation, we can't have that here. Our mission is to **`Share & Serve for Gratis, Open Source, & FULL VERSION!!!`**. Since you had the philosophy that goes against ours, **unfortunately you have to *pay everything* yourself**.  
No no, I mean, **make your own website** like we do, with Netlify. We use **Astro** for the framework. [here template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/astro-quickstart ). Of course, all for $0. You don't need complex things now, all those free tier should be enough to get you started!  
Hey, say thank you pls. At least I didn't tell you to get yourself.. **Wordpress.com** ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€.. Basically horrible idea by making website with website generator where you are required to have internet connection just to edit the site & has severely limited features & full of watermarks on $0 tier. You know.

##### Ahei I have this file..
Whoah, sorry, we cannot post that here. Please wait. We still need to get our Zeronet Port open first. Be patience, we're still figuring out how to get Zumi's website running.

##### Wait what's that?
Nah, he's just eager to showcase his finding with us

##### NO! is that..
Nothing, it's just a regular file, go on. we got customers here.

##### You gotta..
Okay (close call), next!

##### What if I am banned?
Being banned is terrible, I know. But here. These days defamations are so rampant these days. Those people presumes all males or females or certain group of people as.. yeah you know. If you are not one of those guy from Twitter, that would be great. I tired hearing all alots of accusation of this thing over a hand drawn / 3D modeled Loli with full anatomy here and there. **STOP THAT!!**  

Now back to the question. Or maybe I should say, How could you be banned? That above is one of them, Defamation like this example, presuming someone's loli drawing mean that someone is that bla bla bla. Alot of things that upsets us severely. Cyber terrorism takes lots of form.

Okay, real question this time. ... ... **You can still contribute**, no problem, just.. no social & not to mention personal (PM chit chat) **EW!!!** Only the information I found interesting to add as usual. No bad promotion. must be $0, Open Source, Full Version. Yeah, you're welcome, we're trying as best as possible to be neutral (even it is ultimately absolutely impossible), away from politicals, agendas, & controvercies, away from deleting stuffs just because you are proven guilty of certain severe terrorism (although gamers will be warned with an info paragraph) etc. etc. We want content, we need content, we have policy to preserve, not delete. that's all. coz I hate file gone. you too right? So pls say thank you for this. many people not only take off the contribution but also gaslighted everything like they never been there. No, in here your name always be carved.

Okay, before you angery, We also take that off, but instead **it's turned into a mod**, that's it. Thank you for asking, pls put down your cyber-pitchfork, it's never the time to retaliate against us, We're trying our best to accept your says even it's impossible & refusable. Thank you.
